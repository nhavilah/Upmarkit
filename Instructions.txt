This is the instructions for the Upmarkit/Tandjay Projects.
They're built on the same architecture so I've just moved the Tandjay stuff into here.
These projects are powered by React, using MySQL for the server and the express middleware to run the server.
Whilst everything's still in development, there is a process for setup and running of the website.
The backend has to be running first to ensure everything works properly. 
1) Install MySQL server and open up MySQL Workbench
2) Create a new server and run it
3) Open the server.sql file and run it once the server is up and running
4) Get to the folder where app.js is stored and open it in Visual Studio Code or whichever IDE you work in
5) Go to the terminal and type npm start to run the server
Now the backend is ready and the front end can be run.
1) Get to the folder where the front end app.js is stored
2) Type npm start in the terminal
3) It will ask you if you wish to run it on a different port. Type Y and press enter

NOTE: This is not ready for deployment and that is to be determined by the client, as business requirements are changing so this project may be shelved until further notice
